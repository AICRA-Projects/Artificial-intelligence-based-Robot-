# Artificial-intelligence-based-Robot
Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are a powerful combination for automating tasks inside and outside of the factory setting. In recent years, AI has become an increasingly common presence in robotic solutions, introducing flexibility and learning capabilities in previously rigid applications.
This System design a mobile rescue Human detection robotic system based on Arduino to help the people on time which are trapped in natural calamity like disaster, earthquake, floods etc.It gives timely & accurately reflect dynamic situation of human in disaster region like in the underground regions to control room, so that rescue team of Experts & doctors can be sending to the victimâ€™s location for primary treatment and can be sent to the safe place or hospital.
